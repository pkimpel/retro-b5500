    Burroughs B5500 Emulator Utilities Menu
</h1>


<p>This page contains links to a number of standalone utilities for the web-based B5500 emulator. These utilities all run in a web browser. They should generally not be run at the same time the emulator is running from the webUI/B5500Console.html page.

<ul>
    <li><a href="../webUI/B5500ColdLoader.html">Cold Loader</a>
        <br>Utility script to initialize the web-based emulator's disk subsystem and load files from the Mark XIII Burroughs software release tape images.

    <li><a href="../webUI/B5500SyllableDebugger.html">Syllable Debugger</a>
        <br>A user interface for the emulator that is an alternate to B5500Console. This implements a very basic debugging environment that allows you to load an ESPOL program from disk or cards, single-step through its execution, run until a specified stop address, and view the state of memory and the registers in Processor 1. Programs compiled other than with ESPOL cannot be run directly in this debugger -- they must run under the control of the MCP.

    <li><a href="../tools/B5500DiskDirList.html">MCP Disk File Directory List</a>
        <br>A utility to list the files and their attributes in the MCP's disk directory.

    <li><a href="../tools/B5500DiskFileList.html">MCP Disk File Lister</a>
        <br>A utility to display the list of files in the MCP's disk directory. By clicking on one of the file names, the contents of that file will be output to a separate window. This utility understands printer-backup (PBD) files, and will format them as print line images rather than their raw format.

    <li><a href="../tools/B5500LibMaintDir.html">Library/Maintenance Tape Image Directory List</a>
        <br>A utility to read a <code>.bcd</code> Library/Maintenance tape image and produce a detailed directory listing of the files it contains, along with the attributes of those files.

    <li><a href="../tools/B5500LibMaintExtract.html">Library/Maintenance Tape Image Extract</a>
        <br>A utility to read and step through the files in a <code>.bcd</code> Library/Maintenance tape image, displaying each one in a window where they can be viewed or extracted.

    <li><a href="../tools/B5500LibMaintDecoder.html">Library/Maintenance Tape Image Decoder</a>
        <br>A very basic utility that examines the <code>.bcd</code> tape image files and dumps a portion of them. This was originally developed as a study to understand the format of those images.

</ul>
